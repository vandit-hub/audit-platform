# Dashboard ClientReferenceManifest Issue - FIXED

## Problem
The dashboard page (`/`) was throwing a `clientReferenceManifest` error in production builds with Next.js 15.x.

## Root Cause
Conflicting page definitions:
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Server component with auth
- `/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` - Client component with redirect

This created a routing conflict that confused Next.js's build process.

## Solution Implemented
Removed the conflicting `/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` file, allowing the root page.tsx to handle the dashboard route cleanly.

## Changes Made
1. Backed up `/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` to `page.tsx.backup`
2. Removed the conflicting page file
3. Added `postcss` as dev dependency (was missing)

## Test Results
✅ Build completes successfully
✅ No clientReferenceManifest errors
✅ Dashboard page (`/`) loads and redirects to login when unauthenticated
✅ Other dashboard routes (`/observations`, `/audits`) work correctly
✅ Authentication flow remains intact

## Files Modified
- Removed: `/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`
- Updated: `package.json` (added postcss dependency)

## Verification
```bash
npm run build  # Builds successfully
npm start      # Runs without errors
curl http://localhost:3000/  # Returns 307 redirect to /login (expected)
```

The application is now fully functional in production mode!
