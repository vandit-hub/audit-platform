Feedback on 1st MVP:

Edit functionality is limited- plant details, audit details etc. should be editable by admin
Only Admin should have the right to create audits and assign to 1 of the auditors.
When auditor logs in- he should be only seeing his audits. And should not have the right to create new audit
There should be a field of "audit title" when creating new audit. Since there could be stock audit, internal audit etc.
There should be a field of "audit purpose" also
What is the difference between approved and published - VS: Approved represents internal validation and sign-off. Published makes obervation visible to external stakeholders. We can simplify and remove it not needed. 
Can I approve or publish multiple together? - VS: Yes we can implement that.
"approved" buttons - when I select them they should remain highlighted. - VS: Is it related to above point that when multiple observations are selected to be approved, they should be highlighted?
Can I have unlimited auditee logins- in which case Auditee tear 1 and tear 2 persons- we can simply select from the users. At their, both tier 1 and tier 2 users will be able to see the observation and edit the feedback
For auditee- uneditable fields should be frozen- right now it's appearing he can edit but when we're saving it's reverting to original text.
Observation tab close- option should be there
Risk involved- AI assistance if possible - VS: AI will be part of next phase, once the platform is complete.
"Lock sample fields" and "lock text field"- what are these- couldnâ€™t understand purpose - VS: These are just options to lock specific fields, I think better to remove and simplify
From "Auditee Person (Tier 1)"- this should appear in a different section. In this section, there should be 1 more field as "Auditor response to Auditee remarks".
From "HOD action plan" onwards- these look as repeat of "Action plans" section given below- which are looking more appropriate. So this section may be removed.
In the action plans section- date field should be titled as Target Date
Status field should have drop down- Pending (default), Completed. Once this status is changed to completed, re-test field should automatically change to "Retest due"
Against each action plan- auditor should be able to select Retest due, pass or fail.
In a scenario where all the user levels are there- admin should only have the right to setup plants and audits. He cannot view observations and he cannot edit any of them. CXO team should be able to archieve or hide observations if need be. - VS: I'm a bit confused here. Admin is the role with highest privilges, he is the one approving/rejecting observations. Maybe now we should come back to the question of roles and their access, I just started with a simple 3 role setup. A detailed and planned roles list with exact rights would be highly beneficial. This is right time to consider whether we should have Flat roles or Hierarchical roles (a quick ChatGPT answer will explain the difference).
Status of audit- should be editable by admin, auditor and CXO. Status can be- planned, in progress, under review, concluded
"Current Status" field in observations tab should have following options: Pending MR (Default option), MR under review (this should automatically be selected once Auditee gives feedback), Referred back for MR, Observation finalised, Resolved. Note: MR- stands for Management Response
In the report section: Number of risks- should count all except those resolved.
"Due soon" at the bottom right of reports window- should read "Action plan due in (next xx days)"- this should have the log of "Action plans" populated through the observation box (given in the bottom of the box).
Re-test status due pass fail should also populate in the reports section
Downloads capabilities:
Report of different periods with all the observation fields in a table.
Retest report
Observations page: Audit period, audit title filter at the top section should be there
Reports page: should have same filters as observations page
Sorting option in observations tab should be there
Observation creation time stamp should be there
Audit details sheet should have fields for: Visit from when to when, mgt. response date, final presentation date- these fields may differ from one organisation to another
