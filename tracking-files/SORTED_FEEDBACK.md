## Questions for Clarification

### Q1: Approved vs Published
**Question:** What is the difference between approved and published?
**VS Response:** Approved represents internal validation and sign-off. Published makes observation visible to external stakeholders. We can simplify and remove it not needed.

### Q2: Bulk Approval/Publishing
**Question:** Can I approve or publish multiple together?
**VS Response:** Yes we can implement that.

### Q3: Approved Button Highlighting
**Question:** "approved" buttons - when I select them they should remain highlighted.
**VS Response:** Is it related to above point that when multiple observations are selected to be approved, they should be highlighted?

### Q4: Lock Fields Purpose
**Question:** "Lock sample fields" and "lock text field"- what are these- couldn't understand purpose
**VS Response:** These are just options to lock specific fields, I think better to remove and simplify

### Q5: AI Assistance for Risk Analysis
**Question:** Risk involved- AI assistance if possible
**VS Response:** AI will be part of next phase, once the platform is complete.

### Q6: Roles and Access Rights - Needs Discussion
**Question:** In a scenario where all the user levels are there- admin should only have the right to setup plants and audits. He cannot view observations and he cannot edit any of them. CXO team should be able to archieve or hide observations if need be.
**VS Response:** I'm a bit confused here. Admin is the role with highest privilges, he is the one approving/rejecting observations. Maybe now we should come back to the question of roles and their access, I just started with a simple 3 role setup. A detailed and planned roles list with exact rights would be highly beneficial. This is right time to consider whether we should have Flat roles or Hierarchical roles (a quick ChatGPT answer will explain the difference).

## Action Items - Role & Permissions

### P1: Admin Rights & Audit Creation
- Only Admin should have the right to create audits and assign to 1 of the auditors
- Edit functionality is limited- plant details, audit details etc. should be editable by admin

### P2: Auditor View Restrictions
- When auditor logs in- he should be only seeing his audits. And should not have the right to create new audit

### P3: Auditee User Management
- Can I have unlimited auditee logins- in which case Auditee tier 1 and tier 2 persons- we can simply select from the users. At their end, both tier 1 and tier 2 users will be able to see the observation and edit the feedback

### P4: Auditee Field Restrictions
- For auditee- uneditable fields should be frozen- right now it's appearing he can edit but when we're saving it's reverting to original text

### P5: Audit Status Editing
- Status of audit- should be editable by admin, auditor and CXO. Status can be- planned, in progress, under review, concluded
