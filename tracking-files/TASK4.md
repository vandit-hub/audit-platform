# TASK 4: Reports Section Improvements

## Analysis

The reports page currently shows KPIs and target-based data (overdue/due soon). After examining the codebase:

**Current Architecture:**
- Reports page: `/src/app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx` (client component)
- API endpoints:
  - `/src/app/api/v1/reports/overview/route.ts` - KPI data including risk counts
  - `/src/app/api/v1/reports/targets/route.ts` - Overdue and due soon observations based on `targetDate`
- Schema: Observations have `currentStatus` enum (PENDING_MR, MR_UNDER_REVIEW, REFERRED_BACK, OBSERVATION_FINALISED, RESOLVED)
- Schema: ActionPlan model has `targetDate` and `retest` (ActionPlanRetest: RETEST_DUE, PASS, FAIL)

**Key Issues Identified:**
1. **R1**: Risk count logic in overview API already excludes RESOLVED when calculating `byRisk`, but needs verification
2. **R2**: Current "Due Soon" section shows observations by `targetDate` (observation level), not action plans (which are separate entities)
3. **R3**: Retest status from ActionPlan.retest is not displayed anywhere in reports
4. **R4**: No filters exist on reports page - observations page has: plant, process, risk, status, published, search

**Approach:**
- Fix risk count logic to ensure RESOLVED observations are excluded from risk categories
- Modify targets API and UI to use ActionPlan data instead of observation targetDate
- Add retest status column to overdue/due soon tables
- Add filter UI matching observations page to reports page
- Ensure all filters work with existing RBAC/scope restrictions

---

## Subtasks

### 1. Fix Risk Count Logic (R1) ✅ COMPLETED
**Action**: Update `/src/app/api/v1/reports/overview/route.ts` to ensure risk category counts exclude RESOLVED observations
**Context**: The `byRisk` calculation should only count observations with `currentStatus !== 'RESOLVED'`. Currently it counts all observations regardless of resolution status.
**Acceptance**:
- Risk counts (A, B, C) only include observations where `currentStatus` is not RESOLVED
- Test by creating observations with different risk categories and statuses, verify RESOLVED ones don't appear in risk count
- Verify the UI displays correct risk counts
**Files**: `/src/app/api/v1/reports/overview/route.ts`

**Implementation**: Updated line 52 to add condition `&& o.currentStatus !== "RESOLVED"` to the risk category counting logic.
**Status**: ✅ Completed - Risk count now excludes RESOLVED observations

---

### 2. Update Targets API to Use Action Plans (R2 Part 1) ✅ COMPLETED
**Action**: Modify `/src/app/api/v1/reports/targets/route.ts` to query ActionPlan table instead of observation targetDate
**Context**: Currently the targets endpoint queries observations with `targetDate`. Per requirements, it should show action plans from the ActionPlan table with their targetDate and retest status. Action plans are linked to observations via `observationId`.
**Acceptance**:
- Query ActionPlan table with `targetDate` not null
- Join with observation and plant data
- Filter out action plans whose parent observation has `currentStatus = RESOLVED`
- Return action plan data including: id, plan text, owner, targetDate, status, retest status, and related plant/observation info
- Overdue: targetDate < now
- Due soon: targetDate between now and (now + days)
- Maintain existing RBAC/scope restrictions
**Files**: `/src/app/api/v1/reports/targets/route.ts`

**Implementation**: Completely rewrote the route to query `prisma.actionPlan.findMany()` instead of `prisma.observation.findMany()`. Applied RBAC/scope filters through the observation relation. Included observation and plant data via nested include.
**Status**: ✅ Completed - API now queries ActionPlan table with proper filtering

---

### 3. Update Targets API Response Schema (R2 Part 2) ✅ COMPLETED
**Action**: Extend the response schema from targets API to include retest status and plan details
**Context**: The current response returns basic observation data. Need to include ActionPlan-specific fields.
**Acceptance**:
- Response includes: plan text, retest status (RETEST_DUE, PASS, FAIL), and action plan status
- TypeScript types are updated to reflect new response shape
- Backward compatibility maintained (or frontend updated accordingly)
**Files**: `/src/app/api/v1/reports/targets/route.ts`

**Implementation**: Updated response mapping to include: id, observationId, plan, owner, targetDate, status, retest, plant, and observationStatus for both overdue and dueSoon arrays.
**Status**: ✅ Completed - Response schema now includes all ActionPlan fields including retest status

---

### 4. Update Reports Page UI - Label and Table Columns (R2 Part 3 + R3) ✅ COMPLETED
**Action**: Update `/src/app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx` to show "Action plan due in (next xx days)" label and add retest status column
**Context**: Change the "Due Soon" heading and add columns for plan details and retest status
**Acceptance**:
- Change heading from "Due Soon (next {days} days)" to "Action plan due in (next {days} days)"
- Add column for "Plan" showing action plan text (truncated if needed)
- Add column for "Retest Status" showing RETEST_DUE/PASS/FAIL badge
- Update TypeScript types to match new API response
- Apply similar changes to "Overdue" section
- UI displays correctly with proper styling (badges/colors for retest status)
**Files**: `/src/app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx`

**Implementation**:
- Updated TargetRow type to include all ActionPlan fields (plan, retest, observationId, observationStatus)
- Changed "Due Soon" heading to "Action plan due in (next {days} days)"
- Added "Plan" column with truncation and tooltip (max-w-xs truncate + title attribute)
- Added "Retest" column with color-coded badges: yellow for Due, green for Pass, red for Fail
- Updated both Overdue and Due Soon tables with new columns
- Added overflow-x-auto wrapper for responsive table scrolling
**Status**: ✅ Completed - UI now displays action plan data with retest status badges

---

### 5. Add Filter UI to Reports Page (R4 Part 1) ✅ COMPLETED
**Action**: Add filter UI components to reports page matching observations page filters
**Context**: The observations page (`/src/app/(dashboard)/observations/page.tsx`) has filters for plant, process, risk, status, published, and search. Need to add similar filters to reports page, but adapt for reports context.
**Acceptance**:
- Add filter section with dropdowns/inputs for:
  - Plant (dropdown from plants API)
  - Audit (dropdown from audits API with title/date display)
  - Audit period (date range picker: start date and end date)
  - Risk category (A, B, C)
  - Process (O2C, P2P, R2R, INVENTORY)
  - Status (observation currentStatus)
  - Published (yes/no/any)
- Filters maintain state in component
- Clean, consistent styling matching observations page
- Optional: Save/Load/Reset filter preset buttons (like observations page)
**Files**: `/src/app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx`

**Implementation**:
- Added filter state variables for all 8 filters (plantId, auditId, startDate, endDate, risk, process, status, published)
- Created Plant and Audit types to match API responses
- Added loadMeta() function to fetch plants and audits data on mount
- Implemented savePreset(), loadPreset(), and resetFilters() functions with localStorage
- Added filter UI in two rows with responsive grid layout (sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4)
- All filters styled consistently with observations page
- Added Save preset, Load preset, and Reset buttons
**Status**: ✅ Completed - Filter UI is fully functional with preset save/load/reset

---

### 6. Wire Filters to Overview API (R4 Part 2) ✅ COMPLETED
**Action**: Update overview API to accept and apply filter parameters
**Context**: The `/src/app/api/v1/reports/overview/route.ts` currently doesn't accept filters. Need to add query params for filtering observations before calculating KPIs.
**Acceptance**:
- Accept query parameters: plantId, auditId, startDate, endDate, risk, process, status, published
- Filter observations based on provided parameters before calculating counts
- For audit period filter (startDate/endDate), filter by audit.visitStartDate or audit.visitEndDate overlapping with the range
- Maintain existing RBAC/scope logic
- All KPI calculations (total, status counts, approval counts, risk counts, published, due) respect filters
**Files**: `/src/app/api/v1/reports/overview/route.ts`

**Implementation**:
- Extracted all 8 filter parameters from searchParams
- Built filterClauses array with conditions for each filter
- plantId filter: `{ audit: { plantId } }`
- auditId filter: `{ auditId }`
- Audit period filter: Complex OR logic to check if audit.visitStartDate or visitEndDate overlap with the selected date range
- risk, process, status filters: Direct field matching
- published filter: Boolean conversion (published === "1")
- Combined baseWhere (RBAC) with filterClauses using AND operator
- All KPI calculations now respect the filtered observation set
**Status**: ✅ Completed - Overview API now supports all filters with proper RBAC integration

---

### 7. Wire Filters to Targets API (R4 Part 3) ✅ COMPLETED
**Action**: Update targets API to accept and apply filter parameters
**Context**: The `/src/app/api/v1/reports/targets/route.ts` needs to support same filters as overview API
**Acceptance**:
- Accept query parameters: plantId, auditId, startDate, endDate, risk, process, status, published
- Filter action plans based on their parent observation's properties
- For audit period, filter by observation.audit.visitStartDate/visitEndDate
- Maintain existing RBAC/scope logic
- Both overdue and dueSoon lists respect filters
**Files**: `/src/app/api/v1/reports/targets/route.ts`

**Implementation**:
- Extracted all 8 filter parameters from searchParams
- Built observationFilters array with conditions matching overview API
- Applied filters through the observation relation in ActionPlan queries
- Combined RBAC where, RESOLVED exclusion, and all filters using AND operator
- Filters applied to both overdue and dueSoon queries through baseWhere
- Maintained existing RBAC/scope logic and limit functionality
**Status**: ✅ Completed - Targets API now supports all filters via observation relation

---

### 8. Connect Filters to API Calls in Reports Page (R4 Part 4) ✅ COMPLETED
**Action**: Update reports page component to pass filter values to API calls
**Context**: Wire up the filter UI state to the fetch calls for both overview and targets endpoints
**Acceptance**:
- Build query string from filter state values
- Pass filters to both `/api/v1/reports/overview` and `/api/v1/reports/targets` endpoints
- Re-fetch data when filter values change (useEffect dependency)
- Loading states handled appropriately
- Error handling maintained
**Files**: `/src/app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx`

**Implementation**:
- Updated load() function to build URLSearchParams from all filter state variables
- Added days, plantId, auditId, startDate, endDate, risk, process, status, and published to query string
- Query string passed to both overview and targets API endpoints
- Updated useCallback dependency array to include all 9 filter variables (days + 8 filters)
- Data automatically re-fetches when any filter changes due to useEffect dependency on load callback
- Existing error handling and loading states maintained
**Status**: ✅ Completed - Filters now fully connected to API calls with automatic re-fetching

---

### 9. Test and Verify All Requirements ⏭️ SKIPPED
**Action**: Comprehensive testing of all four requirements
**Context**: Ensure all changes work together correctly and meet the original feedback requirements
**Acceptance**:
- R1: Risk counts exclude RESOLVED observations - verified by creating test data
- R2: "Action plan due in (next xx days)" label shows action plans with correct data
- R3: Retest status (RETEST_DUE, PASS, FAIL) displays in both overdue and due soon tables
- R4: All filters work correctly and match observations page functionality:
  - Plant filter
  - Audit filter
  - Audit period filter (date range)
  - Risk filter
  - Process filter
  - Status filter
  - Published filter
- Filters affect both KPI cards and overdue/due soon tables
- RBAC/scope restrictions work correctly with filters
- No console errors or TypeScript errors
- UI is responsive and user-friendly
**Files**: All modified files

**Status**: ⏭️ Skipped per user request - Testing to be done manually

## Dependencies

**Sequential Dependencies:**
- Subtask 2 must complete before subtask 3 (API schema change before response update)
- Subtask 3 must complete before subtask 4 (API response ready before UI update)
- Subtask 5 must complete before subtask 8 (Filter UI exists before wiring)
- Subtasks 6 and 7 can be done in parallel (both API endpoints)
- Subtask 8 depends on subtasks 5, 6, and 7 being complete
- Subtask 9 is final verification after all others complete

**Recommended Order:**
1. Subtask 1 (Quick fix, independent)
2. Subtask 2 (API change for action plans)
3. Subtask 3 (Extend API response)
4. Subtask 4 (Update UI for new data)
5. Subtask 5 (Add filter UI)
6. Subtasks 6 & 7 in parallel (Add filters to both APIs)
7. Subtask 8 (Wire filters to API calls)
8. Subtask 9 (Final testing and verification)

## Implementation Notes

**Key Schema References:**
- `Observation.currentStatus`: PENDING_MR | MR_UNDER_REVIEW | REFERRED_BACK | OBSERVATION_FINALISED | RESOLVED
- `Observation.targetDate`: DateTime (legacy field, being replaced by ActionPlan.targetDate)
- `ActionPlan.targetDate`: DateTime
- `ActionPlan.retest`: RETEST_DUE | PASS | FAIL
- `ActionPlan.observationId`: Foreign key to Observation
- `Audit.visitStartDate`, `Audit.visitEndDate`: DateTime

**Filter Implementation Details:**
- Audit period filter: Check if observation's audit.visitStartDate/visitEndDate overlap with selected range
- Use Prisma's where clause composition for efficient filtering
- Maintain existing scope-based access control for non-admin/auditor users

**UI Considerations:**
- Use badges/colored indicators for retest status (similar to observation status badges elsewhere in the app)
- Truncate long action plan text in tables (show full text on hover or in tooltip)
- Maintain consistent spacing and styling with existing reports page design
- Consider responsive design for filters on mobile devices

### Defects Found and Fixed

**Defect #1: Load Preset Button Not Working (TC9-001)**
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED
- **Description:** Clicking "Load preset" button did not restore filter values from localStorage
- **Root Cause:** `loadPreset` function was memoized with `useCallback` and empty dependency array, causing it to capture stale state references
- **Fix:** Created separate `loadPresetManual` function without memoization for button click handler
- **Files Modified:** `/src/app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx` (lines 78-95, 228)
- **Verification:** Manual testing confirmed Load Preset now works correctly

**Defect #2: Variable Name Conflict in Overview API (Compilation Error)**
- **Priority:** CRITICAL
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED
- **Description:** Variable `published` declared twice causing TypeScript compilation error
- **Root Cause:** Filter parameter `published` conflicted with existing variable in counting loop
- **Fix:** Renamed filter parameter to `publishedFilter` (lines 25, 86)
- **Files Modified:** `/src/app/api/v1/reports/overview/route.ts`
- **Verification:** TypeScript compilation successful, no errors
