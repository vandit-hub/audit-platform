# Test Case Document - TASK2: Observation Fields & Layout

**Task:** Reorganize observation form into sections, add auditorResponseToAuditee field, remove hodActionPlan field
**Test Method:** Playwright MCP Browser Automation
**Date Created:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** Ready for Execution

---

## Test Environment Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Application running at `http://localhost:3000`
- Database seeded with users via `npm run db:seed`
- Valid admin and auditor credentials available

**Test Data Required:**
- **Users (Already Seeded):**
  - Admin User: `admin@example.com` / `admin123`
  - Auditor User: `auditor@example.com` / `auditor123`
  - Auditee User: `auditee@example.com` / `auditee123`

- **Additional Test Data (Create if Missing):**
  - At least one plant in the system
  - At least one audit associated with a plant
  - At least one observation in DRAFT status

**IMPORTANT - Test Data Setup:**
If plants, audits, or observations are not present in the database, create them manually using Playwright MCP from the UI before running the test cases:

1. **Create Plant:** Navigate to Plants page â†’ Create new plant with code and name
2. **Create Audit:** Navigate to Audits page â†’ Select plant â†’ Create audit
3. **Create Observation:** Navigate to Observations page â†’ Create observation linked to audit

Use Playwright MCP to automate this test data creation through the UI workflows, not via direct database manipulation or API calls. This ensures the application's creation flows are also validated.

---

## Critical Test Cases

**Before starting:** Ensure test data exists (users are seeded, but create plants/audits/observations via UI using Playwright MCP if missing).

### TC1: Verify Three-Section Layout in Observation Detail

**Priority:** HIGH
**Objective:** Verify that the observation form is organized into three distinct sections with proper visual separation

**Precondition:** An observation exists in the system

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login as admin or auditor user
3. Navigate to Observations page
4. Click on any observation to open detail view
5. Scroll through the form and verify section structure

**Expected Results:**

The form displays three distinct sections with headers:

**Section 1: "Observation Details"**
- Observation Text *
- Risks Involved
- Risk Category
- Likely Impact
- Concerned Process
- Auditor Person

**Section 2: "Auditee Section"**
- Auditee Person (Tier 1)
- Auditee Person (Tier 2)
- Auditee Feedback
- Auditor Response to Auditee Remarks

**Section 3: "Implementation Details"**
- Target Date
- Person Responsible
- Current Status

**Validation Points:**
- Each section has a visible header with bottom border
- Sections are visually separated (spacing between sections)
- All 13 fields are present across the three sections
- Grid layout shows 2 columns for fields
- No "HOD Action Plan" field is visible anywhere

### TC2: Create and Edit Auditor Response to Auditee Field

**Priority:** HIGH
**Objective:** Verify that the new "Auditor Response to Auditee Remarks" field can be populated and saved

**Precondition:** An observation in DRAFT status exists

**Test Data:**
```
Auditee Feedback: "We have reviewed the observation and partially agree. The implementation will require coordination with the IT department."
Auditor Response to Auditee Remarks: "Acknowledged. Please provide a revised timeline after coordination with IT. The core control weakness must be addressed within this quarter."
```

**Steps:**
1. Login as auditor user
2. Navigate to an observation in DRAFT status
3. Scroll to "Auditee Section"
4. Fill in "Auditee Feedback" field with test data
5. Fill in "Auditor Response to Auditee Remarks" field with test data
6. Click "Save" button
7. Wait for success message
8. Refresh the page
9. Verify both fields display the saved data

**Expected Results:**
- Both fields save successfully
- Success message appears: "Observation updated successfully!"
- After refresh, both fields show the entered text
- Text is not truncated or corrupted

3. Inspect all three sections of the form
4. Use browser search (Ctrl+F) to search for "HOD"
5. Use browser search to search for "Action Plan" in the form area
6. Check the field labels helper by viewing locked fields (if any exist)

**Expected Results:**
- No "HOD Action Plan" field exists in any section
- Search for "HOD" finds no matches in the form
- Search for "Action Plan" only finds the "Action Plans" section below the form (separate feature)
- Field label helper does not include "HOD Action Plan"
- No JavaScript errors related to hodActionPlan

**Validation Points:**

4. Click on an observation to open detail view
5. Check the header area below the title

**Expected Results:**
- Creation timestamp is displayed below the observation title
- Format: "Created: [date] at [time]" or locale-formatted equivalent
- Example: "Created: 10/1/2024, 2:30:45 PM"

---

## Regression Testing Notes

After running these tests, verify:
- Other observation functionality still works (attachments, approvals, notes, action plans)
- Observation creation still works
- Observation search and filtering still work
- Observation list page displays correctly
- Field locking for other fields still works
- Audit functionality not affected
- Reports page still functional
- No console errors on any page
- CSV export for audits still works (separate from observations export)

---

## Pre-Test Checklist

Before executing tests:
- [ ] Run `npm run db:seed` - seed users (admin, auditor, auditee, guest)
- [ ] Run `npm run typecheck` - should pass with no errors
- [ ] Run `npx prisma studio` - verify schema has auditorResponseToAuditee field
- [ ] Run `npx prisma studio` - verify hodActionPlan field is gone
- [ ] Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Start WebSocket server: `npm run ws:dev`
- [ ] Verify login page loads at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Verify test user credentials work (login as admin)
- [ ] **If missing:** Create test data using Playwright MCP via UI:
  - [ ] Create at least one plant
  - [ ] Create at least one audit
  - [ ] Create at least one observation in DRAFT status

---

## Test Data Setup Instructions

**PRIMARY METHOD (Recommended):** Use Playwright MCP to create test data through the UI

**Step-by-step UI-based creation:**
1. **Login:** Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` â†’ Login as admin
2. **Create Plant:** Go to Plants page â†’ Fill form (code: "TEST-01", name: "Test Plant") â†’ Submit
3. **Create Audit:** Go to Audits page â†’ Select "Test Plant" â†’ Fill optional fields â†’ Create audit
4. **Create Observation:** Go to Observations page â†’ Fill form linking to test audit â†’ Create observation

**ALTERNATIVE (API-based):** If UI flow fails, use browser console after logging in as admin:

```javascript
// Create a test observation via API (only if UI method fails)
await fetch('/api/v1/observations', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    auditId: 'YOUR_AUDIT_ID', // Replace with actual audit ID
    observationText: 'Test observation for TASK2 testing',
    auditeePersonTier1: 'Test Tier 1',
    auditeePersonTier2: 'Test Tier 2',
    auditeeFeedback: 'Test feedback',
    // Note: auditorResponseToAuditee will be added via PATCH during tests
  })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
```

**Note:** Prefer UI-based creation with Playwright MCP as it also validates the application's creation workflows.

---

## Success Criteria

All HIGH priority test cases (TC1-TC10) must PASS for successful test execution.
At least 80% of all 13 test cases must PASS (minimum 11 PASS).
No critical defects blocking core observation functionality.
