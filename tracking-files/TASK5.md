# TASK 5: Filtering & Sorting

**Status:** COMPLETED ✅
**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-03
**Developer:** Claude Code

## Implementation Summary

All subtasks have been successfully completed:
- ✅ Backend API: Added auditId, startDate, endDate, sortBy, sortOrder parameters
- ✅ Frontend UI: Added 5 new filter controls (Audit, Start Date, End Date, Sort By, Sort Order)
- ✅ CSV Export: Updated to respect all new filters and sorting
- ✅ Layout: Reorganized into 3 rows for better UX
- ✅ Preset functionality: All new filters integrated with save/load/reset

## Implementation Log

### Backend Changes
1. `/src/app/api/v1/observations/route.ts` - Added audit filter, date range filter, and dynamic sorting
2. `/src/app/api/v1/observations/export/route.ts` - Applied same filters to CSV export endpoint

### Frontend Changes
1. `/src/app/(dashboard)/observations/page.tsx` - Added UI components and state management for all new filters

### Key Features Implemented
- **Audit Filter**: Dropdown to filter observations by specific audit
- **Date Range Filter**: Start/End date inputs with overlap logic for audit visit dates
- **Sorting**: Dynamic sorting by 5 fields (createdAt, updatedAt, riskCategory, currentStatus, approvalStatus)
- **Filter Layout**: Reorganized into 3 responsive rows (4+4+3 grid)
- **Preset Support**: All new filters work with save/load/reset functionality

## Analysis

After examining the codebase, I've identified the following key findings:

### Current State
1. **Observations Page** (`/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/(dashboard)/observations/page.tsx`):
   - Already has 6 filters implemented: Plant, Process, Risk, Status, Published, and Search text
   - Has preset save/load/reset functionality
   - Missing: Audit filter and Audit Period (date range) filters
   - Missing: Sorting functionality

2. **Reports Page** (`/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx`):
   - Has 8 comprehensive filters: Plant, Audit, Start Date, End Date, Risk, Process, Status, Published
   - Serves as the reference implementation for date range filtering

3. **API Backend** (`/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/api/v1/observations/route.ts`):
   - Currently supports: plantId, risk, process, status, published, q (search text)
   - Missing: auditId, startDate, endDate filters
   - Missing: Sorting capability (currently hardcoded to `orderBy: { createdAt: "desc" }`)

### Implementation Approach

The task requires:
1. Adding **Audit Title** filter (auditId) - requires API and UI updates
2. Adding **Audit Period** filter (startDate/endDate) - requires API and UI updates with date range logic
3. Adding **Sorting** functionality - requires API sort parameter and UI sort controls

The implementation will follow the proven pattern from the Reports page, reusing similar filter logic and UI components. The date range filtering needs special attention as it must filter observations by their associated audit's visit dates.

### Database Context
- Observations are linked to Audits via `auditId`
- Audits have `visitStartDate` and `visitEndDate` fields
- Audits also have an optional `title` field
- Relevant sortable fields on Observation: `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `riskCategory`, `currentStatus`, `approvalStatus`

## Subtasks

### 1. Add Audit Filter to Backend API
**Action**: Update the GET endpoint in `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/api/v1/observations/route.ts` to support `auditId` query parameter

**Context**: Users need to filter observations by specific audit. The Reports page already implements this pattern, which we can follow. This allows filtering by audit title/identifier.

**Acceptance**:
- API accepts `auditId` query parameter
- When provided, only observations for that audit are returned
- Existing filters continue to work in combination with auditId
- Test with: `GET /api/v1/observations?auditId=<valid-id>`

**Files**: `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/api/v1/observations/route.ts`

---

### 2. Add Audit Period (Date Range) Filter to Backend API
**Action**: Update the GET endpoint in `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/api/v1/observations/route.ts` to support `startDate` and `endDate` query parameters with audit period overlap logic

**Context**: Users need to filter observations by audit period (visit dates). This requires joining to the Audit table and checking if the audit's visitStartDate/visitEndDate overlap with the filter range. The Reports overview API (`/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/api/v1/reports/overview/route.ts`) already implements this exact logic in lines 51-72, which should be adapted.

**Acceptance**:
- API accepts `startDate` and `endDate` query parameters (ISO date strings)
- Implements overlap logic: audit period overlaps with filter range if:
  - Audit visitStartDate is within filter range, OR
  - Audit visitEndDate is within filter range, OR
  - Audit period completely encompasses the filter range
- Handles edge cases: only startDate provided, only endDate provided, both provided
- Existing filters continue to work in combination with date filters
- Test with: `GET /api/v1/observations?startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-12-31`

**Files**: `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/api/v1/observations/route.ts`

**Dependencies**: Should be implemented after Subtask 1 for logical progression

---

### 3. Add Sorting Support to Backend API
**Action**: Update the GET endpoint in `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/api/v1/observations/route.ts` to support dynamic sorting via `sortBy` and `sortOrder` query parameters

**Context**: Users need to sort observations by various fields. Currently sorting is hardcoded to `createdAt: desc`. Need to make it dynamic while maintaining a sensible default.

**Acceptance**:
- API accepts `sortBy` query parameter with allowed values: `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `riskCategory`, `currentStatus`, `approvalStatus`
- API accepts `sortOrder` query parameter with values: `asc`, `desc` (default: `desc`)
- Default sorting remains `createdAt: desc` when no sort parameters provided
- Invalid sortBy values default to `createdAt`
- Sorting works in combination with all existing and new filters
- Update the `orderBy` clause in the Prisma query to use dynamic values
- Test with: `GET /api/v1/observations?sortBy=riskCategory&sortOrder=asc`

**Files**: `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/api/v1/observations/route.ts`

---

### 4. Add Audit Filter UI Component to Observations Page
**Action**: Add an "Audit" dropdown filter to the observations page UI in `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/(dashboard)/observations/page.tsx`

**Context**: The UI needs to allow users to select a specific audit from a dropdown. The Reports page already has this implemented (lines 166-176), which can serve as a reference. The component should display audit title, plant code, and visit start date.

**Acceptance**:
- Add `auditId` state variable (similar to existing `plantId` state)
- Add Audit dropdown in the filter grid with "All" as default option
- Dropdown shows: `{audit.title || "Untitled"} — {audit.plant.code} ({visitStartDate})`
- Audit list is already being fetched and stored in `audits` state
- Filter triggers loadRows() when changed (via useEffect dependency)
- Audit filter persisted in preset save/load/reset functionality
- Update localStorage key format to include auditId: `{ plantId, auditId, risk, proc, status, published, q }`

**Files**: `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/(dashboard)/observations/page.tsx`

**Dependencies**: Requires Subtask 1 (backend API support)

---

### 5. Add Audit Period (Date Range) Filter UI Components to Observations Page
**Action**: Add "Start Date" and "End Date" input fields to the observations page filter section

**Context**: Users need to filter observations by audit period. The Reports page has this exact implementation (lines 177-184) with date input fields. This allows filtering observations whose audit visit dates fall within the specified range.

**Acceptance**:
- Add `startDate` and `endDate` state variables
- Add two date input fields labeled "Audit Start Date" and "Audit End Date" in the filter grid
- Use `type="date"` inputs for browser-native date pickers
- Both dates are optional and work independently or together
- Date filters trigger loadRows() when changed (via useEffect dependency)
- Date filters persisted in preset save/load/reset functionality
- Update localStorage format to include dates: `{ plantId, auditId, startDate, endDate, risk, proc, status, published, q }`
- Rearrange filter grid to accommodate new filters (suggest 2 rows with 4 columns each)

**Files**: `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/(dashboard)/observations/page.tsx`

**Dependencies**: Requires Subtask 2 (backend API support)

---

### 6. Add Sorting UI Controls to Observations Page
**Action**: Add sorting dropdown controls to the observations page, positioned in the filter section

**Context**: Users need to sort the observations table by different fields. This requires adding two dropdowns: one for the field to sort by, and one for the sort direction (ascending/descending).

**Acceptance**:
- Add `sortBy` and `sortOrder` state variables (default: `sortBy="createdAt"`, `sortOrder="desc"`)
- Add two new dropdowns in the filter section:
  - "Sort By" dropdown with options: Created Date, Updated Date, Risk Category, Current Status, Approval Status
  - "Order" dropdown with options: Newest First (desc), Oldest First (asc)
- Sorting controls trigger loadRows() when changed (via useEffect dependency)
- Sorting preferences persisted in preset save/load/reset functionality
- Update localStorage format to include sort: `{ plantId, auditId, startDate, endDate, risk, proc, status, published, q, sortBy, sortOrder }`
- Update the loadRows() function to pass sortBy and sortOrder as query parameters

**Files**: `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/(dashboard)/observations/page.tsx`

**Dependencies**: Requires Subtask 3 (backend API support)

---

### 7. Update CSV Export to Include New Filters
**Action**: Update the exportCsv() function in `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/(dashboard)/observations/page.tsx` to include new filter parameters

**Context**: The CSV export should respect all active filters including the newly added audit, date range, and sort parameters. This ensures exported data matches what users see on screen.

**Acceptance**:
- Update exportCsv() function to include auditId, startDate, endDate, sortBy, sortOrder in query string
- Format: `/api/v1/observations/export?plantId=...&auditId=...&startDate=...&endDate=...&sortBy=...&sortOrder=...`
- Test CSV export with various filter combinations to ensure filtered results are exported

**Files**: `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/(dashboard)/observations/page.tsx`

**Dependencies**: Requires Subtasks 1-3 (backend API support for all filters)

---

### 8. Update Export API Endpoint to Support New Filters and Sorting
**Action**: Update the export endpoint at `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/api/v1/observations/export/route.ts` to support auditId, startDate, endDate, sortBy, and sortOrder parameters

**Context**: The CSV export API endpoint needs to apply the same filtering and sorting logic as the main GET endpoint to ensure consistency. This likely involves reusing the same query building logic.

**Acceptance**:
- Add support for all new query parameters: auditId, startDate, endDate, sortBy, sortOrder
- Apply the same filter logic implemented in Subtasks 1-3
- Apply the same sorting logic implemented in Subtask 3
- Exported CSV respects all active filters and sorting
- Test with various filter combinations to verify correct data export

**Files**: `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/api/v1/observations/export/route.ts`

**Dependencies**: Requires Subtasks 1-3 (backend filter/sort logic must be implemented first to be reused)

---

### 9. Reorganize Filter Layout for Better UX
**Action**: Refactor the filter grid layout in the observations page to accommodate 8 filters plus sorting controls in a clean, organized manner

**Context**: The observations page currently has a single row of 6 filters. Adding audit, date range (2 fields), and sorting (2 fields) requires reorganizing the layout for better visual clarity and usability. Consider the Reports page layout as reference.

**Acceptance**:
- Rearrange filters into a logical grid (suggested: 2 rows of 4 columns)
- First row: Plant, Audit, Audit Start Date, Audit End Date
- Second row: Risk, Process, Status, Published
- Third row or separate section: Sort By, Sort Order, Search text
- Maintain responsive design (`sm:grid-cols-X lg:grid-cols-Y`)
- All filters remain easily accessible and clearly labeled
- Preset buttons (Save/Load/Reset/Export CSV) remain visible below filters
- Visual hierarchy is clear and user-friendly

**Files**: `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/(dashboard)/observations/page.tsx`

**Dependencies**: Should be done after Subtasks 4-6 (all UI components are added)

---

### 10. Integration Testing and Documentation
**Action**: Perform comprehensive integration testing of all new filters and sorting functionality, and update any relevant documentation

**Context**: All new features need to be tested together to ensure they work correctly in combination. Edge cases, preset functionality, and export functionality all need verification.

**Acceptance**:
- Test all individual filters work correctly (audit, date range)
- Test sorting by each field in both directions
- Test multiple filters combined (e.g., plant + audit + date range + risk + sort)
- Test preset save/load with all new fields
- Test preset reset clears all fields including new ones
- Test CSV export with all filter combinations
- Verify filters work correctly for different user roles (Admin, Auditor, Auditee, Guest)
- Test edge cases:
  - Date range with only start date
  - Date range with only end date
  - Date range with both dates
  - Invalid audit ID (should return empty results)
  - Combining text search with all other filters
- Verify browser back/forward doesn't break filter state
- Check mobile/responsive layout works correctly
- Document any issues found and verify fixes

**Files**: Manual testing across multiple files, potential bug fixes as needed

**Dependencies**: Requires all previous subtasks (Subtasks 1-9) to be completed

---

## Dependencies

**Sequential Dependencies:**
- Subtask 4 depends on Subtask 1 (audit filter UI needs backend support)
- Subtask 5 depends on Subtask 2 (date range UI needs backend support)
- Subtask 6 depends on Subtask 3 (sort UI needs backend support)
- Subtask 7 depends on Subtasks 1-3 (CSV export needs all backend filters)
- Subtask 8 depends on Subtasks 1-3 (export API reuses filter logic)
- Subtask 9 depends on Subtasks 4-6 (layout reorganization after UI components added)
- Subtask 10 depends on Subtasks 1-9 (testing requires full implementation)

**Recommended Implementation Order:**
1. Backend first: Subtasks 1, 2, 3 (can be done in parallel or sequence)
2. Frontend next: Subtasks 4, 5, 6 (can be done in parallel)
3. Export functionality: Subtasks 7, 8 (can be done in parallel)
4. Polish: Subtask 9 (layout refinement)
5. Validation: Subtask 10 (comprehensive testing)

## Technical Notes

### Filter Logic Pattern
The date range filter should use the same overlap logic as Reports overview API:
```typescript
// Audit period overlaps with filter range if:
if (startDate && endDate) {
  // Audit visitStartDate within range OR visitEndDate within range OR audit encompasses range
  auditDateFilter.OR = [
    { visitStartDate: { gte: new Date(startDate), lte: new Date(endDate) } },
    { visitEndDate: { gte: new Date(startDate), lte: new Date(endDate) } },
    { AND: [{ visitStartDate: { lte: new Date(startDate) } }, { visitEndDate: { gte: new Date(endDate) } }] }
  ];
}
```

### Sorting Implementation
Use a whitelist approach for sortBy to prevent injection:
```typescript
const allowedSortFields = ['createdAt', 'updatedAt', 'riskCategory', 'currentStatus', 'approvalStatus'];
const sortBy = allowedSortFields.includes(searchParams.get("sortBy") || "")
  ? searchParams.get("sortBy")
  : "createdAt";
const sortOrder = searchParams.get("sortOrder") === "asc" ? "asc" : "desc";
```

### Prisma Query Pattern
The Prisma query needs to join to Audit table for date filtering:
```typescript
if (startDate || endDate) {
  filterClauses.push({ audit: auditDateFilter });
}
```

### UI/UX Considerations
- Keep filter UI consistent with Reports page for familiarity
- Ensure all filters are clearly labeled
- Provide visual feedback when filters are active
- Maintain preset functionality for user convenience
- Export should always match visible filtered results
