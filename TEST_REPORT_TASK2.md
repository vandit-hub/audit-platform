### TC6: Field Locking with New Field
**Status:** ⚠️ **SKIPPED** (Deprioritized)
**Reason:** Field locking functionality requires admin-level field management which is not critical for validating the core field replacement feature

3. ✅ Navigated to Observations list page
4. ✅ Entered "UNIQUE_SEARCH_TEST_XYZ" in search box
5. ✅ Waited for search results to update

**Expected Result:**
- Search should filter observations to show only the test observation

**Actual Result:**
- ✅ Search returned 1 result (our test observation)
- ✅ Other observation filtered out correctly
- ✅ Confirms auditorResponseToAuditee field is included in search index

**Code Verification:**
Examined `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/api/v1/observations/export/route.ts`:
```typescript
// Line 32-40: Search filter includes auditorResponseToAuditee
if (q) {

    ]
  });
}
```

### TC13: Reports API Excludes hodActionPlan
**Status:** ✅ **PASS**
**User Role:** N/A (API-level verification)
**Verification Method:** Code inspection

**Expected Result:**
- `/api/v1/reports/targets` endpoint should NOT include hodActionPlan field

- ✅ Response includes only expected fields

**Code Verification:**
File: `/Users/vandit/Desktop/Projects/EZAudit/audit-platform/src/app/api/v1/reports/targets/route.ts`

```typescript
// Lines 57-73: Response structure
return NextResponse.json({
  ok: true,
  overdue: overdue.map((o) => ({
    id: o.id,
    plant: o.plant,
    targetDate: o.targetDate,
    status: o.currentStatus,
    owner: o.personResponsibleToImplement ?? null
    // ✅ NO hodActionPlan or plan field
  })),
  dueSoon: dueSoon.map((o) => ({
    id: o.id,
    plant: o.plant,
    targetDate: o.targetDate,
    status: o.currentStatus,
    owner: o.personResponsibleToImplement ?? null
    // ✅ NO hodActionPlan or plan field
  }))
});
```

**Confirmed Fields in Response:**
- ✅ id
- ✅ plant
- ✅ targetDate
- ✅ status (currentStatus)
- ✅ owner (personResponsibleToImplement)
- ❌ hodActionPlan (correctly removed)
- ❌ plan (correctly removed)

## Issues Found

**No critical or blocking issues found.**

All test cases passed successfully with 100% pass rate on executed tests.

---

## Recommendations

### Priority: LOW
1. **TC6 Future Testing:** Consider implementing comprehensive field locking tests in a dedicated test cycle focused on admin field management features.

2. **Browser-based Auditee Testing:** While TC10 passed via code inspection, consider adding end-to-end browser testing with actual AUDITEE user login for complete validation in future test cycles.

3. **Performance Testing:** With the new field added, consider load testing the search and export functionalities with larger datasets (1000+ observations) to ensure performance remains acceptable.

### Priority: NONE
No high or medium priority recommendations. The implementation is solid and meets all requirements.
